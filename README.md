[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rizowski/Poo.pi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rizowski/Poo.pi)

At Towers Watson Exchange Solutions there is only 1 stall for many men in the department. It is quite a problem waddling over there to only find out that you cant go. So this is an interface to show if the stall is available. Next will be a study on if we try to kill each other by racing to the door as soon as it is open.
